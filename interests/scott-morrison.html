			<td><p>Clontarf Foundation - Outback Adventure</p> <p> </p> <p>In 2015, the Clontarf Foundation established an academy at Endeavour High School in my electorate of Cook.</p> <p> </p> <p>Catering for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander male students from years 7-12, the Academy exists to improve their education, discipline, life skills, self-esteem and employment prospects. By doing so this equips them to participate meaningfully in society.</p> <p> </p> <p>I have seen firsthand the results the program is delivering locally and wanted to share this experience with others. So in August I joined some Clontarf graduates, their mentors and some of the business leaders who financially support the program on an outback trek to Bourke and Brewarrina.</p> <p> </p> <p>The aim was to give the kids another experience outside of school and footy. A mentoring type exercise allowing the boys to converse with people who have life experiences of their own to share and meet the Alumna.</p> <p> </p> <p>Visiting the Bourke and Brewarrina academies was further affirmation to me that the Governments, both State and Federal, should continue to support the Foundation.</p> <p> </p> <p>The boys and community attitude towards the boys future is one of promise and blue sky. The boys all have long term plans and goals for their future which would not exist without the Clontarf academies in their schools.</p> <p> </p> <p>I hope to make this journey an annual pilgrimage to the various Clontarf academies around Australia. Again taking with me mentor like figures from all walks of life, together with the financial support of Clontarf sponsors who made the trek possible.</p> <p> </p> <p>All transportation, meals and accommodation (mostly camping in some of the most beautiful outback areas of NSW) were directly covered by the Clontarf Foundation.</p> <p> </p> <p>I look forward to making similar trips with these amazing young leaders in the future</p></td>
